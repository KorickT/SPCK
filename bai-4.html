        ‘Frightening’: record-busting heat and drought hit Europe in 2022
        Continent set for further drought in 2023, scientists say, as
        unstoppable impacts of climate crisis mount Damian Carrington crisis had
        “frightening” impacts in Europe last year, with heatwaves killing more
        than 20,000 people and drought withering crops, an EU report has found.
        Its writers said drought was already baked in for many farmers in 2023.
        The only way to limit the rising damages of global heating was rapidly
        to cut carbon emissions, they said. The report, from the Copernicus
        Climate Change Service (C3S), said widespread heatwaves had led to
        Europe suffering its hottest summer on record in 2022, by a large
        margin. These would have been virtually impossible without global
        heating and had led to many premature deaths.

        People in southern Europe endured 70-100 days of heat stress, where the
        temperature felt like at least 32C, accounting for wind and other
        factors. In the UK, temperatures passed 40C for the first time. The
        heat, plus low rainfall, caused drought that affected more than a third
        of the continent at its peak, the report said, making it the driest year
        on record. Flows in almost two-thirds of Europe’s rivers were lower than
        average. High temperatures also meant that the carbon emissions from
        summer wildfires were the highest in 15 years and the European Alps lost
        record amounts of ice from glaciers. Overall, Europe experienced its
        second-warmest year ever recorded, with temperatures rising at twice the
        global average rate – faster than on any other continent. Over the past
        five years, the average temperature has been 2.2C higher than in the
        pre-industrial era. One bright spot in the report was that Europe
        received its highest amount of solar radiation in 40 years, owing to
        lower cloud cover, enabling above-average levels of solar-power
        generation.
