        Texas to New Jersey: Tracking the Toxic Chemicals in the Ohio Train
        Inferno

        When a freight train carrying more than 100,000 gallons of hazardous
        chemicals derailed and burned in East Palestine, Ohio, this year, it set
        off a panic over rail safety and the toxic fallout for communities
        downwind. But less has been known about the origins of the chemicals
        themselves and their intended destination. Much of the train's vinyl
        chloride freight — which was ultimately incinerated by emergency
        responders to avert a wider explosion — came from a chemicals plant in
        La Porte, just outside Houston, Texas, that is run by OxyVinyls

        When a freight train carrying more than 100,000 gallons of hazardous
        chemicals derailed and burned in East Palestine, Ohio, this year, it set
        off a panic over rail safety and the toxic fallout for communities
        downwind. But less has been known about the origins of the chemicals
        themselves and their intended destination. Much of the train’s vinyl
        chloride freight — which was ultimately incinerated by emergency
        responders to avert a wider explosion — came from a chemicals plant in
        La Porte, just outside Houston, Texas, that is run by OxyVinyls, the
        chemical arm of Occidental Petroleum, according to the shipment records
        released by the Environmental Protection Agency. The chemicals were on a
        1,600-mile journey to an Oxy plant in Pedricktown, N.J., that makes
        plastic used in PVC flooring. The details of the cargo were included in
        an administrative order filed last month by the E.P.A. that was based on
        shipment data provided by Oxy and other shippers. Oxy had more than
        700,000 pounds of vinyl chloride on the train that derailed, the records
        show. An E.P.A. official on Monday confirmed the accuracy of the
        information.
