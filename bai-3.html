        Eco-anxiety, climate doom, environmental existential dread - as green
        journalists, we see these terms used a lot - and often feel them
        ourselves. While there's a lot to be worried about when it comes to the
        climate and nature crises, we must not lose hope - because hopelessness
        breeds apathy. The media has an important role to play in combatting
        climate doom. It's our job to be truthful and accurate in our reporting,
        not trying to downplay or greenwash the situation. But it's also our job
        to show that there is hope.

        'Really encouraging': Plastic bag bans work, say campaigners Plastic
        bags are everywhere - littering our streets, clogging up our rivers, and
        choking wildlife in the ocean. But after years of campaigning from
        environmental groups, many places have banned them entirely. Over 100
        countries now have a full or partial ban on single-use plastic bags.
        Between 2010 and 2019, the number of public policies intended to phase
        out plastic carryout bags tripled. The results of such tough rules are
        starting to show.

        Wildlife crossings: US rolls out $350 million in funding to prevent
        collisions and improve habitats The US Department of Transportation is
        rolling out funding for wildlife crossings along busy roads. Studies
        show than more than 350 million vertebrate animals are killed by traffic
        in the US each year. Meanwhile, about 200 people are killed each year in
        collisions involving wildlife and vehicles in the US, according to
        federal officials. Now, Indigenous groups as well as state and local
        governments will have access to $350 million (â‚¬320) to combat the issue.
